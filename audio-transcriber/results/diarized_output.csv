Speaker 00: How are you doing?
Speaker 01: I'm doing well. Thank you for asking. I'm sorry to hear that you haven't been doing super well. We will definitely talk about that today. With that in mind, let's go ahead and definitely get started. So let's set our agenda. We will, as always, start with a review of the symptoms you've been experiencing in the past week. Then I am looking forward to going over your action plan with you from the past week and talking through kind of how it went, what got in the way if anything got in the way. Today, and then today we'll talk a little take a moment to talk a little bit about kind of progress so far in therapy and see kind of how you're feeling and how things have been going. And we'll discuss maybe anything that we might use to help support you additionally. If you're noticing that things have been kind of challenging, especially as far as getting action plans going. I know after our first session, one of the things you shared the following week was you just kind of ended up feeling like totally overwhelmed and just really felt like you couldn't reach out to the person you plan to and it was really challenging. So we'll talk about kind of anything that may be came up this week, whether that felt the same or different. And then we'll make a new action plan for this week. And is there anything that you want to add to that agenda for today?
Speaker 01: Let's start with our sort of symptom review or thermometer check on how your depression symptoms are feeling. So over the last week, since the last time we met, so that would be last Thursday. How often have you been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things? Not at all on several days on more than half the days or nearly every day.
Speaker 00: More than half the days.
Speaker 01: And over the last week, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed or hopeless? Not at all on several days, more than half the days or nearly every day.
Speaker 00: Most of the days, I would feel down, so I would say nearly every day.
Speaker 01: And over the last week, how often have you been bothered by having trouble falling or staying asleep or by sleeping too much? Not at all on several days on more than half the days or nearly every day.
Speaker 01: Not at all on several days on more than half the days or nearly every day.
Speaker 01: And over the last week, how often have you been bothered by having poor appetite or overeating? Not at all on several days, more than half the days or nearly every day.
Speaker 00: Several days.
Speaker 01: Not at all on several days, on more than half the days or nearly every day.
Speaker 01: Not at all on several days, more than half the days or nearly every day.
Speaker 00: I would just get distracted really easily and that would happen for like several days.
Speaker 01: Okay. And over the past two weeks, how often have you been bothered by moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed or the opposite being so fidgety or restless that you've been moving around a lot more than usual. Not at all on several days, more than half the days or nearly every day.
Speaker 00: I haven't been having those problems so not at all.
Speaker 01: Okay.
Speaker 01: Not at all on several days, more than half the days or nearly every day.
Speaker 01: And I know that sort of in our first week of working together, you were at about an eight in the second week is about a 10. Now we're up at about a 12. And we talked a little bit last week about 12 being kind of in the range of what we call moderate depression. So above mild, which is where you were two weeks ago when I know you said you were kind of having an unusually good week.
Speaker 01: And I wanted to check in with you thinking about how your past week has been. Does that label of moderate depression? Does it feel like it matches what you've been experiencing?
Speaker 00: And I just lost interest in doing a lot of things. And I just feel more lonely and down most of the times. So yeah.
Speaker 01: Okay. So having some loss of interest, feeling a little lonelier. And I know we talked about loneliness and something you've been kind of trying to work on and some things to be getting in the way of engaging action plans. Sort of in the past two weeks, and I'm eager to hear how things have gone this week. Would it is does it feel like there's anything else about the past week that it feels really important for me to know before we dive into your action plan?
Speaker 00: So, um, sleep hasn't been so good with me for the past week. I tend to wake up easily and like during the night, I would just.
Speaker 01: I know from yeah, I think so. Okay. Thank you for telling me about that. I appreciate that that will certainly keep an eyeball on that and we can discuss it further if you'd like to if we have time. Is it something you want to save time to discuss today?
Speaker 01: So, let's go ahead and review your action plan. Do you have your patient packet with you to pull up?
Speaker 01: Right.
Speaker 00: Right.
Speaker 01: So I hear you when you say kind of on the day you were planning to do it, it sort of slipped your mind, but it sounds like when you remember you kind of had an intention to reach out and you were going to or maybe you even went so far as reaching out, I'm not sure. Tell me more about what happened when you when you did remember to reach out and what you tried and what it feels like got in the way for you.
Speaker 00: to go to the movies with me, I feel like maybe I wouldn't have such a good time with her.
Speaker 00: And those thoughts just prevented me from picking up the phone at that very moment. And then I forgot about it.
Speaker 00: And I don't know, time just flew by.
Speaker 01: And so, I want to ask in what you're describing, it sounds like there's a little bit of, sometimes you maybe forget to put the action plan into practice. But it also sounds like you did remember and there was a time you actually sat down, you remembered enough to kind of sit down and try and pick up the phone and call your friend. At what point in the process, did you start to have some of those thoughts about how she's going to react to this request and what if I don't enjoy myself and what if this actually isn't a very pleasant activity? When did that happen in the process?
Speaker 00: So, I would think that, okay, I would have to call my friend today.
Speaker 00: but before pressing her number,
Speaker 00: and it would be just all over my head
Speaker 00: and I couldn't really call her in that moment.
Speaker 01: it sounds like it got in the way for you. Like it was really, really challenging
Speaker 01: And when you thought to yourself, for instance, what if she doesn't respond well to this? Was there anything that you noticed yourself
Speaker 00: with her own plans.
Speaker 00: And I mean, she has a lot of friends
Speaker 00: and maybe she didn't have enough time to spend with me.
Speaker 00: And well, that thought of getting maybe her and down, it just made me feel a little discouraged.
Speaker 01: it seems like it's really likely that the outcome of taking that risk is not gonna be good. I can so understand feeling like, oh, I don't want to do this at all. And rather kind of avoid it.
Speaker 00: Exactly.
Speaker 01: And so thank you so much for telling me about that. And first of all, I want to highlight
Speaker 01: which was even after forgetting kind of the first date on which we had planned for you to reach out to your friend, you remembered later and on remembering later, you didn't immediately save yourself like, well, I missed the date, so I'm just not gonna do it. You had an intention at that point also to like sit down and do this action plan and make it happen. And it sounds like something really got in the way for you and we're gonna talk about that today and maybe try a strategy that might be helpful for you when that kind of a barrier comes up. But I'm really impressed with how you were able to kind of
Speaker 01: And even though it was missed, you kind of improvised a little bit and were like, okay, I can do it on a different day.
Speaker 01: Thank you.
Speaker 01: and how you're talking about kind of continuing to really like feel lonely and just really not feel that sense of connection with others. One of the things that I wanna highlight is and talk about with you is in thinking about kind of how you've been feeling lonely and how you've been kind of wanting this connection with others, not having it for the past couple of weeks and feeling like these action plans couldn't happen. I'm not terribly surprised to see that your depression symptoms really haven't gotten much better. It makes a lot of sense to me. Remember we talked about kind of how we think about depression and how depression symptoms can very much be linked to our socializing and our time spent with others, especially one on one time that we spend with others and that socialization can be really important, and can be helpful to protect against depression and also when we don't get it, it can be one of those things that can be related to depression symptoms. I'm wondering, or you, does it feel like
Speaker 01: those things are feeling linked in the past few weeks as we've been talking through some of this stuff?
Speaker 00: Oh, yeah, definitely. Like, so I know that connecting with others would make me feel better, but it's really hard for me to actually reach out and give myself there to do it.
Speaker 01: It sounds like it's been so challenging and also a little bit like you've been feeling like you're kind of white knuckling it through, trying to make it happen.
Speaker 01: And that really makes me wonder whether it might be helpful for you to have some tools in your back pocket to use when you're noticing, for instance,
Speaker 01: or maybe this isn't such a good idea, or maybe my friends not gonna respond very well. And maybe if there's a tool that you can use in those moments to kind of combat some of those thoughts a little bit, which can feel so real when you have them in your mind,
Speaker 01: What do you think?
Speaker 01: I'd really love to review actually Form Q in the packet with you. So that is on page 28. There's a little umbrella in the upper right hand corner of the page. Let me know when you get there.
Speaker 00: Each 28.
Speaker 01: Wonderful. So this is a little bit of what I'm thinking might be a little bit of what you're experiencing. So when it takes some time to kind of review this together and see what you think, whether you think this magic or experience.
Speaker 01: So one of the things that this portion of the packet reviews
Speaker 01: or kind of the glass half empty feeling that we all sometimes get. And the challenge with pessimism is that
Speaker 01: Remember kind of at the end of every session before we wrap up and always asking you, what do you think might get in the way of engaging in this action plan this week? Our ability to kind of foresee where barriers might be and kind of figure out potential problems and obstacles. Those things are all a part of kind of being able to be effective in making something happen, right? Oh, it might rain today. So I want to be able to, I want to bring an umbrella so that I'm ready for that rain.
Speaker 01: if you're finding that kind of the glass half empty stuff is the only stuff that you notice that your mind is paying attention to. It's really hard to see the like, what if the glasses have fuller or what if it doesn't rain? What if it's really sunny today?
Speaker 01: does it feel like lately you have been having trouble tuning into the kind of possible positive things that might happen?
Speaker 00: Yeah, I think that sounds pretty like me.
Speaker 01: Okay.
Speaker 01: And so I wonder, it sounds like maybe then when you're kind of planning activities or sitting down, for instance, at the phone, maybe you're finding yourself worrying that you might get projected or you might not enjoy the time you spend or you might not enjoy the activity, might not enjoy the time with others.
Speaker 01: That kind of happening for you.
Speaker 00: Yeah, like those are some of the worries that I have.
Speaker 00: And so you know how we tried the action plans a couple of times and I just found myself being a little stressed out in those situations.
Speaker 01: really down in the way of kind of picking up the phone for you. And it sounds like also when that happens, your mind kind of floods with all of those possible negative outcomes, but I didn't hear in any of that thought process, like, what if this is great? That sounded like it was harder for you to access in that moment. And it makes so much sense to me that you would feel like.
Speaker 00: And it makes so much to me then that you would feel like it's really likely that a bad outcome would happen because it's all that's on your mind.
Speaker 00: So when this kind of thing happens and you are definitely not the only person to experience this, that is why we have this whole section of this manual that is devoted to this, right? One of the things that we can do is we can take a look at a couple of different strategies. And you can select one, we can kind of navigate toward one. But I think we can use a little bit of what you've been describing is happening for you to help narrow down which of these strategies might feel most effective to start with.
Speaker 00: but it'll be the first thing we try. Okay, sounds good.
Speaker 00: There's a section called How the Strategies Work. Do you see that section? It's underlined.
Speaker 00: So there's a couple different things we can start with. One is called Devils Advocate. One is called Weng the Evidence. And one is called Changing Perspectives. Now, the one that I am thinking of for you is called Weng the Evidence based on what you've said. But I want us to review these together and see what you think because maybe your experience has been slightly different than what I'm picking up.
Speaker 00: Devils Advocate first. And the idea with Devils Advocate is very much what it sounds like, right? So it is all about kind of practicing the muscle of seeing the other perspective that your brain might not be going to immediately on its own. So the first thing that we do is you would write down all the reasons for not doing your action plan, every single one.
Speaker 00: that you came up with are actually not very good reasons for not doing your action plan.
Speaker 00: to kind of argue with itself when it's starting to have that kind of glass half empty stance.
Speaker 00: And that one can be really helpful if you're noticing that it's just really, really challenging to kind of come up with reasons why you're initial.
Speaker 00: Might not make a ton of sense.
Speaker 00: The second strategy when evidence is a strategy that kind of is based on our past experiences a little bit. So the first thing that we do is you write what your prediction is. So you've noticed that you've had a couple of predictions about how things will go when you were describing to me those thoughts that come up when you sat down to make that phone call to your friend.
Speaker 00: of one of the bad things that you think might happen if you go through with the action plan.
Speaker 00: that you've ever done something like that.
Speaker 00: Maybe it did. Maybe it's happened before.
Speaker 00: we'll sort of, it helps sometimes to read a just
Speaker 00: Do you have any questions about that? Sometimes that one can sound a little confusing when we first describe it.
Speaker 01: but I think if we actually do it, it'll make much more sense.
Speaker 00: It'll make much more sense. Okay. And then changing perspectives is the third kind of of these options. And changing perspectives is similar to kind of the other strategies, but you can apply it to anything you're doing, not just the action plan, and actually with a lot of these, we can apply them to anything. So you'll practice thinking of one event that happened either during the day or in the past.
Speaker 00: who are also there thinking about how they might have viewed that experience, what they might have been thinking or feeling,
Speaker 00: And you use all of that to kind of help yourself right down what were the positive aspects of this experience. And again, we're sort of just building up that kind of positivity muscle.
Speaker 00: is one standing out to you more than the others?
Speaker 01: I would just go with the second strategy, the one that you mentioned.
Speaker 00: And if a preference comes up for a different one later, feel free to let me know. And we can always try that too. Okay. Okay. So for weighing the evidence, you and I are going to turn to page 24 form M. It has a couple boxes on it and they're kind of blue and green. Let me know when you're there.
Speaker 00: So what you and I are going to do is we're actually going to use this in coming up with your new action plan for this week. And so we're going to use this to think a little bit about an activity that you're planning and what you're predicting in terms of the likelihood of a bad outcome. And so what we want to do is actually generate a new action plan for you. And we're just going to use this to guide us as we generate that new action plan.
Speaker 00: But the first thing I want to do is I want to pick what your new activity is going to be.
Speaker 00: So I'm wondering
Speaker 00: Get a little bit of a fresh start. And I know we talked about that last week as well.
Speaker 00: What's your kind of goal? So this action plan for this week is actually going to look a little bit different than the action plans looked previously. It's going to be on page 27 instead of page 7. It's for P. Let me know when you're there.
Speaker 00: Okay. So what do you think what's your social goal for this week? What's your goal for the upcoming week?
Speaker 00: Yeah.
Speaker 00: Okay. And so thinking about sort of some of the activities that might be in line with your goal that can also incorporate kind of that social element and help you with some of that loneliness that you've been feeling. What are three different ways that you can kind of get out and also spend time with someone else?
Speaker 01: So it's been a while.
Speaker 00: with another person? What would be the social element to that?
Speaker 01: So I would be with other people and doing yoga
Speaker 00: And do you ever talk to people at that yoga class or chat with them before after the class? Do you know anyone from it?
Speaker 01: And I haven't really chated to anyone.
Speaker 00: what would it be like to either maybe bring another friend with you or talk to someone at the yoga class?
Speaker 01: Talking to another person in the class.
Speaker 00: Talking to another person at the yoga class. So kind of going to yoga and talking to someone there. Yeah.
Speaker 00: who you've wanted to talk to but you haven't before?
Speaker 01: She was really active participant in the class.
Speaker 00: and talk to the person who's pretty active there.
Speaker 00: that feels like it is also a social activity?
Speaker 01: Well, I've only seen her from time to time.
Speaker 01: We haven't really had a chance to get to know each other,
Speaker 00: Okay. So you could also talk to your neighbor. So we've got two things with folks that you don't know very well. What's the third activity that you could do that's in line with kind of this goal of getting out more?
Speaker 01: Um, she's friend and right. And her name's Rachel.
Speaker 01: So it'd be easy to get to her house too. So I could visit her.
Speaker 00: And that one also feels like it's in line with your goal of kind of getting out more than going to Rachel's would be like you'd still would help you kind of is it about getting out of your house or getting outside. And that's what I think it would be like. And that's what I think it would be like if you could just clarify the goal so that I understand it. Getting out of the house. Getting out of the house. Okay. Yeah. Totally makes sense. Okay. So we got three great ideas here. We've got. Going to yoga class and talking to that active person who you have wanted to talk to what you happened before. We've got talking to your neighbor who you don't know, but you've been sort of interested in engaging with. And we've also got visiting your friend Rachel who did who only lives like a couple of blocks away. And so it was pretty pretty close to you. And so thinking about what feels most feasible and rewarding just within this one week, which one feels like kind of let's call it maybe sometimes like the lowest hanging for right like the easiest to reach thing. And one of them also feel good to you if you accomplished it. Which of these activities kind of would meet both of those things.
Speaker 00: Okay. And then I want to check in with you and ask because I know the socializing part has felt really challenging. What do you think is like how challenging would it feel to go up and talk to that one person who is pretty active who you haven't spoken to before?
Speaker 01: I don't even think about it.
Speaker 00: But like also maybe could there could be some barriers maybe hard to get a man to her.
Speaker 00: Right. Sometimes we feel nervous about things and they turn out to be wonderful. And so I want to I'm going to check in one more time and kind of think about like lowest hanging fruit and feasibility.
Speaker 00: Both kind of talking to your neighbor and visiting Rachel.
Speaker 00: Is she someone who you run into frequently where like this would definitely happen within a week?
Speaker 01: So I think I can bump into her pretty often.
Speaker 00: And it sounds also like this yoga studio one and also this kind of visiting your friend Rachel might be something that we can save for the future because both of these plans on really awesome.
Speaker 00: And maybe it's something that you'll be able to use for some of those feelings of nervousness you noticed when kind of thinking about going to that yoga class. Okay, that's on the thing. Okay.
Speaker 00: Okay, so you're going to talk to your neighbor this week.
Speaker 00: Oh, wonderful. Okay, so your activity is going to be talking to your neighbor. So in that cell on the upper left in blue under activity, let's type in, we'll both write it in talk to neighbor, do you know your neighbor's name?
Speaker 01: Yeah, I think it was Sophie.
Speaker 00: So talk to Sophie.
Speaker 01: So I feel like there's a good chance that it's going to work out well.
Speaker 00: Okay, and if you put yourself in your shoes, kind of maybe the moment before you're going to go out there, when you're thinking about going out and you're thinking about talking to this person who haven't talked to her before. Can you put your mind set for a moment?
Speaker 01: Okay.
Speaker 00: Okay.
Speaker 00: What are some of the thoughts that you think might come to you in a moment like that?
Speaker 00: Yeah, and when you have kind of those kinds of questions in your mind.
Speaker 00: Okay, so that's like there's a prediction in there. Yeah, that makes so much sense. It's going to be an awkward conversation. What feels like the likelihood that it's going to be awkward?
Speaker 00: Out of 100.
Speaker 00: 70 or 80%. Okay. So do you want to which of those numbers would you like to put in that box under predicted likelihood of bad outcome?
Speaker 01: I will put down 75.
Speaker 00: The likelihood of a bad outcome is like 75%. So if you went out 100 times 75 of those that wouldn't go well.
Speaker 00: And I want you to think just for a moment here about all the times in the past when you've talked with someone who you haven't known very well. When was the last time you did something like that?
Speaker 00: It was maybe a little awkward, but it wasn't unbearable. It actually went in your words like pretty well. Yeah. And so. And what about kind of before that any other times that you maybe talk to someone that you just haven't known that well?
Speaker 00: And you think of a few other instances where you had conversations with books you didn't know very well. And what about, and I know you said, so he's like pretty friendly. So what about like pretty friendly people? You've talked to that you didn't know very well.
Speaker 01: and we have quite a fun conversation.
Speaker 00: So I know you said there haven't been too many of these lately, but even thinking over pretty far back in your life, when you think about all the times you've talked to someone who's like pretty friendly, even if you didn't know that they're not well.
Speaker 00: it really didn't go well.
Speaker 01: I don't think there were any instances where it went really badly,
Speaker 00: Okay, so actually when you think over your past experience,
Speaker 00: Right. It's actually, and bad. So it's so interesting. So your brain is telling you there's a 70% or 75% likelihood that this is not gonna go well.
Speaker 00: Mm-hmm. Yeah, and so we're not gonna fill out the actual experience part yet. We have the past experience is 0%. But I'm really interested to find out when you actually talk to Sophie,
Speaker 00: about the likelihood of it not going well?
Speaker 01: Yeah, just thinking back and thinking of all the pretty good experiences
Speaker 01: that I would have a bad outcome with Sophie
Speaker 00: All right, so like a little draft even in what you're expecting. Yeah. And so that change as you get closer to doing this actual action plan, and I wanna scoot back to page 27 so that we can finish our action plan before we wrap up for today. Okay.
Speaker 00: So at any time that you notice that your brain is doing that glass half empty thing with your action plan, like, oh, this isn't gonna go well because this bad thing is gonna happen. You can always scoot back to page 24 and you can use that form to kind of do the same thing that we just did. Okay. Yeah. Any questions about how to do that? Yeah.
Speaker 00: Mm-hmm. Makes sense to you. Okay, awesome. So I wanna get detailed just like we always do and go through the steps of how you're gonna make this action plan happen. So the plan is to talk to Sophie. So what are you gonna do? What's, what will you do to make that happen?
Speaker 01: and see if she's standing outside of her house
Speaker 01: and open my door and walk out
Speaker 00: that are like ready to go to offer? Mm-hmm. Yep. Okay. You don't have to make cookies or go buy them. So that's awesome. So gonna look outside and see whether she's out there and then head over when she is. And if you don't see her out there, what else could you do?
Speaker 00: And if you end up not seeing her a bunch this week, is there any other way that you could find to talk to her?
Speaker 00: Yeah. Did you knock on her door?
Speaker 00: All right. So we got a couple different strategies we can use. I'm hearing maybe nothing on her door sounds a little intimidating, possibly.
Speaker 00: looking to see if she's outside and going over. And when do you want to start kind of keeping an eyeball out? How easy is it for you to see whether Sophie's outside?
Speaker 01: It's pretty easy.
Speaker 00: And is there any way you can maybe like remind yourself to kind of keep checking since it's not something that you will necessarily know until it's happening?
Speaker 01: So when I see the cookies in my kitchen, maybe it'll serve as like a good reminder for me to check out the window.
Speaker 00: And if you need what's another reminder, you might be able to put up.
Speaker 01: I can also write in my calendar.
Speaker 01: Where's your calendar? It's hanging right next to my door.
Speaker 00: Where's your calendar?
Speaker 00: So maybe that is that something you could do after we talk today? Maybe put a reminder on your calendar?
Speaker 01: I think I can do that. All right.
Speaker 00: and I can start checking the day.
Speaker 00: will take all things told? Checking for Sophie going over to say hi, chat in.
Speaker 00: Okay, let's put that down. And who's involved?
Speaker 01: Sophie and me.
Speaker 00: Sophie and you and where is it going to happen?
Speaker 01: So I'm on the street.
Speaker 00: I'm on the street.
Speaker 00: You already have good cookies and what else do you need if I'm anything at all?
Speaker 00: All right. So some good good reminder on your calendar
Speaker 00: So whenever you do this activity or if you don't, as always, mark the smiley face at the bottom and then write down if you couldn't do it what got in your way. And for this barrier strategy, even on days when you don't need it, practice it at least once a day. Just get in the habit of practicing building this muscle
Speaker 00: What am I thinking about? What's going to happen if I do this?
Speaker 00: And then let's see what it's really like when I do it and can do it for anything. Sounds good.
Speaker 01: Nope. I think I'm good.
Speaker 00: Okay. So to summarize very briefly,
Speaker 00: You're going to go talk with Sophie, your neighbor. You're going to bring her a cookie. You got reminders that you're going to put on your calendar because it's not something you can necessarily control the timing of. And you've got this barrier strategy for helping with some of what you talked about. That like your brain has a tendency to kind of predict the worst.
Speaker 00: You feel it about going into this week.
Speaker 00: A little confident. I love it. I can't wait to hear about it. And is there anything else that you need before I let you go for this week?
Speaker 01: I think I'm all good.
Speaker 00: I'll see you next Thursday. Bye, Julian. Bye.
